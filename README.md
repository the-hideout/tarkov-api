## Development 🔨

Prerequisites:

- Install [Wrangler](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler)
- Run `wrangler login` - (needed for k/v store and secrets)

Start the API server:

- Start the dev environment by running `npm run dev`
- Then open up the playground on [localhost:8787/___graphql](http://127.0.0.1:8787/___graphql)

## Deployment 🚀

If you wish to deploy locally and have permissions to do so, run the following command:

```bash
wrangler publish
```

## Secrets 🔑

This section is about adding secrets to the API

### Twitch

This API also calls the Twitch API to get current stream stats for Escape from Tarkov. Tokens are only valid for 60 days so a new token needs to be added to the cloudflare console for the API every 60 days or so

Steps:

1. Go to the [Twitch API Console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console)
2. Generate a new secret
3. Run the following command with the Twitch CLI utility: `twitch token`
4. Provide your clientId and secret
5. Upload the new token which the CLI tool returns to the cloudflare console as an encrypted secret for the `TWITCH_TOKEN` variable

> Note: The Twitch token process is tedious and really locked to just one user. This is a process we may remove or replace in the future
